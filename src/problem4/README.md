My approach to problem 4: 3 way sum to n

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuangNV23062004/Nguyen_Vinh_Quang.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd Nguyen_Vinh_Quang/src/problem4
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Extra Notes:

- The 3 approach I've used for this problem are formula(Math), loop, and recursion.
- The math approach has the lowest complexity but require extra mathematic knowledge.
- The loop approach does not requires extensive mathematic knowledge, in trade of to the performance, it still work with large numbers.
- The idea behind the recursion approach is similar to the loop, but with extra drawback when a large number are entered it'll exceed the maximum call stack.
